=head1 DESCRIPTION

heyPass is a centralized authentication system made for any web application that
needs user authentication.  The heyPass system is hosted, maintained, and
managed by hey.nu Network Community Services and Megagram Managed Technical
Services in a joint venture to help web application developers provide a safe,
user privacy-controlled authentication and profile data sharing system.

All data stored within heyPass by individual applications can be shared with
other heyPass-powered applications based on the user's permission and the
application's permission settings.  This system makes it easy for an application
to store both public and private data for a user and share only permitted data
with other applications that have been given permission by the user.

Through this system, no heyPass-powered applications have access to the user's
login information, email address, or any other identifying data.  Upon
successful login, the only piece of data that an application is given is a user
UUID that identifies that user with that application.  Only after the
application requests specific profile data and the user has given explicit
permission via a web interface will an application be able to access additional
data stored within heyPass.  This system ensure that a user's privacy is
maintained at the levels that they prefer.  For example, a user is not required
to provide an application their email address or identity information just to
login.

This system was originally designed as a central authentication system for
hey.nu Network Official sites, but it is now being made available to the general
public.  Any application developer or application owner may use the heyPass
system for their applications.  Any heyPass user can create their own
applications and any application developer can distribute their heyPass-powered
applications to others.

=head2 new

  my $hp = Hey::heyPass->new({
    uuid => '1f0123de58d123ddb4da123851399123',
    key => 'your-app-password-here',
  });

Creates the heyPass object to be used later on for requests.

=over 4

=item uuid [required]

Your application's UUID.  This is assigned upon creation of your application at
the heyPass website.  Your UUID is listed on the application detail screen.
This is not a secret.  In fact, you can freely give this out if you'd like other
applications to potentially access your data (if *both* you and your users allow
it).

=item key [required]

Your application's password.  This is a secret!  Anyone with this password can
do anything with your data that your application can.  You get to choose this
value when you setup your new application in heyPass.  It's best to keep this
password long and complicated.  You can change it at any time at the heyPass
website.

=item return_url [optional]

This is the URL that heyPass will send the user to when the user has either
successfully logged with heyPass or if the user hit the cancel button.  If you
set it here, it becomes the default return_url for all requests.  Otherwise, it
can be set for any request that sends the user to heyPass.

=item access_url [optional]

It shouldn't ever be necessary to use this, but if you are in a special
situation where the predefined heyPass API URL needs to be set to a different
value, you'd do that with this.

  print "Status: 302\nLocation: $login->{url}\n\n";

Sends a request to heyPass to start the login process for a non-authenticated
user.  Returns the URL where you will send the user to login as well as the
login_code that will be used later to check to see if the user is logged in, to
get the logged-in user's UUID, and other things.

WARNING!  Do *not* use login_code as a session id for your application.  At any
moment the login_code may need to change (the user logged out and you want them
to log back in, etc) and this will mess up your sessions.  You should use your
own session management system like L<CGI::Session|CGI::Session> or something like
that.  Don't rely on heyPass to maintain your session ids!  That's not what
login_code is for.

=over 4

=item return_url [optional-ish]

If you didn't set this when you created your $hp object, you are required to do
it here.  If you did set it, this will override it for just this one request.

=item attributes [optional]

A hashref containing the attributes that you'd like to have access to.  The
attribute is formatted "APP_UUID/ATTRIBUTE".  You need to know the UUID of the
application that owns the attribute and the name of the attribute that you want
access to.

When the user logs in with heyPass, they will be prompted to grant access to
these attributes to your application.  The user can override any of the settings
that you provided (permission, expiration).  Depending on how the user answers,
they may be asked everytime they login, once it expires, or never again.

The attributes that you list here must have been permitted to be shared by the
application that owns the data.  This means they have set either "read-only" or
"read-write" access to the data.

  $hp->logout({ # logout based on the user's uuid.  doesn't return anything at all either on success or failure.
    user => $user,
  });

Performs a logout action.  Either logout just this single login_code (leaving all other sessions alone)
or logout every session for this user for your app.  You'll use either "login_code" or "user", but
not both at the same time.

=over 4

=item login_code [required, without user]

If provided, the provided login_code will be logged out.  The user will be
logged out of your application for the computer that the user is sitting at.
Any existing sessions for this user for your application at other computers will
not be logged out.

=item user [required, without login_code]

This is the user's UUID.  If provided, the user will be logged out of your
application at every computer that was used to log into your application.  This
is considered a "global application logout".

FYI: If a user wants to do a true global logout (logout of all heyPass-powered
apps for this user), they must do that through the heyPass website.  Your
application can direct them there, but the user has to click the button to make
it happen.

  });
  print "User's UUID is $user." if $user;
  die "User isn't logged in... login_code is invalid, expired, or whatever." unless $user;

Get the logged in user's UUID.  This is the static identifier that lets your
application know that this user is who they are.  This value never changes for
each individual user.  You will use this value in your databases or wherever to
match against each time this user logs in or wishes to perform an action.
According to your application, the user's UUID is their identity.  You will use
the user's UUID to perform other tasks, like writing to their attributes,
logout, requesting attribute grants, and reading attributes.

If $user is null, the login_code is not valid.  This means the user is not
authenticated and should be treated as such.  Either the login_code was never
authenticated, the authentication expired, or the user was logged out.

    ],
  });

Get the specified attributes from the user's profile.  For attributes in your
application's namespace (starting with your app's UUID), you don't need
permission from the user to get the data.  For any other namespace, you must
have a valid, non-expired grant from the user.  You get a grant using "grant" or
during the initial "login".  If you don't have a valid grant, your request for
the denied attributes will be ignored and omitted from the response.  If the
attribute or application UUID doesn't exist, that too will be ignored and
omitted.  If you have a valid grant for a piece of data, but the data doesn't
exist for this user (it was never written to), it'll be omitted from the
response.

Request a grant for attributes for a user.  The application that owns the
attributes being requested must have specified that the attributes are either
read-only or read-write.  The user will need to visit the heyPass site to grant
this permission.  If you use "login_code", a URL will be provided that you can
send the user to.  Otherwise, the user will be prompted next time they login.

=item login_code [required, without user]

Provide the login_code for the current user session.  Returned will be the URL
that the user must visit to grant the requested permissions.  The user must
be present to use "login_code" for this.

=item user [required, without login_code]

Provide the user's UUID instead of login_code to request permission to
attributes.  In doing so, the user doesn't need to be present when you make this
request.  The next time the user logs into your application, they'll be asked to
give permission.  You can use this method for user-not-present batch requests.

=item attributes [required]

A hashref containing the attributes that you'd like to have access to.  The
attribute is formatted "APP_UUID/ATTRIBUTE".  You need to know the UUID of the
application that owns the attribute and the name of the attribute that you want
access to.

When the user logs in with heyPass or is sent to heyPass with the returned URL,
they will be prompted to grant access to these attributes to your application.
The user can override any of the settings that you provided (permission,
expiration).  Depending on how the user answers, they may be asked everytime
they login, once it expires, or never again.

The attributes that you list here must have been permitted to be shared by the
