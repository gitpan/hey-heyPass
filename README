NAME
    Hey::heyPass - Client for heyPass Centralized Authentication System

DESCRIPTION
    heyPass is a centralized authentication system made for any web
    application that needs user authentication. The heyPass system is
    hosted, maintained, and managed by hey.nu Network Community Services and
    Megagram Managed Technical Services in a joint venture to help web
    application developers provide a safe, user privacy-controlled
    authentication and profile data sharing system.

    All data stored within heyPass by individual applications can be shared
    with other heyPass-powered applications based on the user's permission
    and the application's permission settings. This system makes it easy for
    an application to store both public and private data for a user and
    share only permitted data with other applications that have been given
    permission by the user.

    Through this system, no heyPass-powered applications have access to the
    user's login information, email address, or any other identifying data.
    Upon successful login, the only piece of data that an application is
    given is a user UUID that identifies that user with that application.
    Only after the application requests specific profile data and the user
    has given explicit permission via a web interface will an application be
    able to access additional data stored within heyPass. This system ensure
    that a user's privacy is maintained at the levels that they prefer. For
    example, a user is not required to provide an application their email
    address or identity information just to login.

    This system was originally designed as a central authentication system
    for hey.nu Network Official sites, but it is now being made available to
    the general public. Any application developer or application owner may
    use the heyPass system for their applications. Any heyPass user can
    create their own applications and any application developer can
    distribute their heyPass-powered applications to others.
