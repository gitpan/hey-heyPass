DESCRIPTION

Documentation: https://heypass.hey.nu/interface/guestdocs/

If you want to have a heyPass siteId/siteKey for your application, please check to see if there is an automated way to do this (not yet at time of writing).  If there still isn't, contact me (Dusty Wilson <cpan-heypass@dusty.hey.nu>) and I will get you started.

DEPENDENCIES

THANKS

A big thank you goes out to all of our members at hey.nu Network who have helped us test heyPass throughly.  A special thank you goes to ssba for his testing and early adoption of heyPass in his projects.  And of course, thank you to the authors and contributors of LWP, XML::Simple, Crypt::SSLeay, and all dependent projects for making this module so easy to make. If it weren't for them, I would have had to actually write real code to have done this.  Thanks!
